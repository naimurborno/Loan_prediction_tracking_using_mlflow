# Project Title
The project aims to develop a machine learning application for predicting loan approval using data from historical loan applications. Leveraging machine learning techniques, the application aims to provide insights into whether a loan application is likely to be approved or rejected based on various factors such as income, credit history, loan amount, etc.
